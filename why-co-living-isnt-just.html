        <p class="lead"> <em>A teardown of co-living and why I think it's striking a chord with nomads.</em> </p>

        <img class="post-img" src="img/why-coliving.jpg" alt="Why co-living isn't just a Silicon Valley reinvention of roommates">

        <p>At the tail end of 2017, The Guardian posted an article with the headline "Silicon Valley thinks it invented roommates. They call it 'co-living'".</p>

        <p>The TL;DR is: Just because Silicon Valley takes an existing idea and privatize it, doesn't make it something new.</p>

        <p>It didn't seem like the author had a personal vendetta against co-living, it probably just happened to be an example she used to explain a bigger point. But when I read the article it struck me that I don't think everyone gets co-living.</p>

        <p>On the surface, co-living seems like an overpriced room for privileged people, but then companies like Roam or Stayawhile are raking in VC money to target the mid-term rental space.</p>

        <p>At Kin, we've also put our bet on co-living by building a <a href="/about">simplified booking management app tailored for co-living spaces.</a></p>

        <p>So what's going on here? Does co-living provide real value, and is there a market worth pursuing?</p>

        <h2>What makes co-living valuable</h2>

        <p>Before you can understand why people are paying for co-living, you gotta understand that products aren't just about utility, but the entire customer experiences in getting a job done.</p>

        <p>IKEA is the perfect example.</p>

        <p>On the surface, IKEA sells furniture. But IKEA has understood something critical; they aren't in the business of selling furniture but in the business of helping you furnish your home.</p>

        <p>This is subtle, but it makes all the difference.</p>

        <p>A normal furniture store sells you furniture, but IKEA helps you with every single job involved in furnishing your home.</p>

        <p>Need to figure out if the couch fits your living room? Boom, here's a tape measurer. </p>

        <p>Hangry after you've spent all day in IKEA? Boom, here's some food.</p>

        <p>Need to transport your new stuff? Boom, here's cheap delivery options.</p>

        <p> <em>(This is the idea behind Jobs To Be Done theory, if you're interested check out Competing Against Luck by Clayton Christensen)</em> </p>


        <h2>Applying  JTBD to Co-living</h2>

        <p>You might think <em>"Sure, but aren't there a ton of products that meet people's accommodation needs?"</em>.</p>

        <p>If you don't know the target market it might seem that way. Let's have a look at how the accommodation market used to look:</p>

        <h3>Travellers</h3>

        <p>Tourists that travels for short periods of time. These travelers fall into two categories, high-end and low-end. Hotels and hostels solve their problems. In the last five years, Airbnb has also entered the scene, meeting similar needs.</p>

        <h3>Long-term tenants</h3>
        <p>These are the average renters. They want a long-term deal and landlords try to lock contracts for as long as they can. They usually furnish their space and pay utilities themselves. </p>

        <h3>Business travellers</h3>

        <p>Business travelers either stay long- or short-term, and companies often give them deals on hotels or furnished apartments.</p>

        <p>This is a simplified model, and I'm sure there are more edge cases, but this covers the broad strokes of the market, except for a new and obscure type of traveler. </p>

        <h2>Enter 'The Nomad'</h2>

        <p>The Nomad has a few key traits:</p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Works in tech either as a freelancer, entrepreneur or remote worker.</li>
            <li>Has a hyper-flexible lifestyle and travels a lot between cities or countries</li>
            <li>Often stays for months at a time, so they can't always commit to long-term contracts</li>
            <li>Works from home, co-working spaces or cafés</li>
            <li>Often travels alone</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>How do I know so much about this segment? Well, both I and my co-founder David have traveled the world full-time working remotely the last 3-5 years.</p>

        <p>The job we need to get done is 'Have a place to stay short- to -mid-term.'</p>

        <p>Just like with our IKEA example, that job comes with a lot of smaller jobs that currently aren't being met by what's on the market.</p>

        <p>Since we work remotely and don't want long-term contracts, we need:</p>

        <p><ul>
          <li>A place to work from (good wifi, no distractions, good chair and table) </li>
          <li>Furnished apartment, preferably with great wifi</li>
          <li>Flexible move-in and -out</li>
          <li>Community and like-minded people</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Renting a room in Airbnb is a good alternative I know many nomads use. The problem with Airbnb is that traveling alone can sometimes be isolating, and when you don't have a base, building long-term relationships can be hard. </p>

        <p>Add Airbnb's rising prices and varying amenities, and renting a room there isn't as ideal as it might sound.</p>

        <p>This is where co-living saves the day. Co-living spaces provide:</p>

        <p><ul>
          <li>Flexible move-in and -out </li>
          <li>Spaces to work from</li>
          <li>Lots of like-minded people</li>
          <li>Often fully furnished</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>As a nomad, this is very convenient. When we come to a new city just checking-in to a co-living space is a preferred choice.</p>

        <h2>The rise of the nomad</h2>

        <p>So how many nomads are there? We now know there is a need for the product but are there enough people willing to buy?</p>

        <p>One estimate done by the company Minaal <a href="https://blog.minaal.com/how-many-digital-nomads/">said ‘millions’</a>. But it’s a hard question to answer and it depends on how you decide to classify a nomad. </p>

        <p>Another way to look at the problem is that there are currently about 180 co-living spaces(<a href="/coliving-list">Check out our master list of co-living spaces here</a>), and unless they are able to run at a loss there has to be enough people to fill those spaces continiously.</p>

        <p>Some of them don't directly target nomads, You+ and Harbour, the two biggest co-living companies in the world, are targeting lonely youth in big Chinese cities, so nomads aren't the only segment that fit the model. </p>

        <p>But the big question is, how many nomads will there be in the future? </p>

        <p>Peter Levels did a talk in 2015 where he made the bold claim that <a href="https://levels.io/future-of-digital-nomads/">there would be one billion nomads by 2035.</a> </p>

        <p>He reasoned that by calculating the increase of freelancers, decrease in flight prices and the rise of internet speeds, we should see a surge of nomads.</p>

        <p>Personally, I think this estimate is the way too optimistic. It's easy for people like us to believe that everyone must want to live this lifestyle, "because why wouldn't they, it's fantastic!".</p>

        <p>But if you look at companies that are fully remote like Automattic, the company behind WordPress, out of their 616 employees only 10 or so are traveling nomads.</p>

        <p>I've seen the same trend in companies I've worked for.</p>

        <p>Most people enjoy being close to family, have a home base and not need to worry about the crappy internet speeds.</p>

        <p>But there is a particular type of weirdo that would thrive as a nomad, and as opportunities grow with more remote positions and better infrastructure for freelancers, I have no doubt the number of nomads will grow.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Co-living isn't just about the room and the price, but the community and the small jobs they solve for a certain part of the market. My prediction is that that segment will grow and a few companies will profit heavily.</p>
